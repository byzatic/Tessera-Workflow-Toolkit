# Tessera Workflow Toolkit

A collection of modular Java libraries that bridge external systems and services
with the Tessera Data Flow Engine. These libraries facilitate the development
of custom routines (workers), integrations, and services.

Each module is a standalone JPMS-compliant Java module and Maven artifact.
